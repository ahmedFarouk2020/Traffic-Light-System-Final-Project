# Traffic-Light-System-Final-Project-
Final Project of the course "Coding for embedded SW" that simulates Traffic Light System

# General system description
You are required to design and implement an embedded software of a digital traffic light system.

## The system has the following input:
1. Push button for pedestrian cross request. (Analogue interface)
2. Emergency detection control unit. (UART interface)

## The system has the following outputs:
1. A LED with red color.(PWM interface).
2. A LED with yellow color. (PWM interface).
3. A LED with Green Color. (PWM interface).
4. Two seven segments displaying data. (7 DIO pins). (both are connected on the same data
bus).
5. Two seven segments displaying enable pin( 1 DIO pin per each one).
